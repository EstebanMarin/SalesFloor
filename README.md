I believe in an iterative approach to software: Quality fast software is based on feedback and experimentation. 
For that, we need the right tools to compartmentalize, and route our services as we see fit, with enough room to grow. Main reason we use Nginx and Docker for our dev process. 
### CORS, reverse-proxy, Ngnix, Docker, docker-compose
To work efficiently, and manage complexity I push to have a dev environment that:
- encourages decoupling
- Share a common network
- easy to start
- based in Nginx, docker, docker-compose.

### Build nginx container. 
```shell
docker build -t nginx-local:latest - < nginx.Dockerfile 
docker run --name test-nginx -d -p 80:80 nginx-local:latest                                                        
```
# Releases

```
#### frontv1.0
Front end build with `next.js` the new and certainly not last JS framework that promises to solve all the internet problems, for the n-th time. Still cool tough.
